    Welcome to specdb, a simple suite of software for accessing
    public spectroscopic databases and for creating your own.
    A principal philosophy guiding specdb is that spectral datasets --
    even in this era of `big data` -- are modest in size and therefore
    can be widely disseminated on local machines.  The primary challenge
    has been a lack of uniformity in data storage:  both the basics
    like formatting and the specifics such as calibration units.
    There have been positive steps by the IVOA including a draft
    Spectral Data Model but these have not yet been widely adopted.
    specdb aims to address this issue by ingesting many public datasets
    and by providing the hooks to IVOA protocols.
    <p></p>

    The other guiding principle of specdb is to keep things simple.
    Databases are limited to a single HDF5 file and the software
    repository contains simple Python tools and scripts to query
    catalogs and retrieve spectra.  These Python tools aren't even
    necessary:  only the software to read HDF5 files.

        igmspec: This is the first major database release in specdb.  Its v02
        includes over 500,000 quasar spectra from the SDSS-DR7, BOSS-DR12, and
        2QZ surveys, as well as ~15 public datasets drawn from HST, Keck,
        Magellan, Gemini and the VLT.

        <h3>
        The <a href="https://github.com/specdb/specdb">specdb repository</a> provides
        code to generate a specdb database from your own proprietary spectral dataset.
        Ideally, this would be added to a public specdb database upon publication.
